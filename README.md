# writer2epub
Personal copy of Writer2epub, based on the original version 1.1.28 found at:  http://writer2epub.it/en/
* this is **not** intended for general use or as a replacment of the original
* it is only a fine tuned version based on my needs

---
the long term goal will be:
* to intergrate these changes into the original project
   * should this be desired by the original autor `Luca Calcinai` 

---

* most of this information will be found in the Wiki pages
